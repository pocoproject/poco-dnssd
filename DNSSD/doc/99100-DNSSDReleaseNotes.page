!!!Release 2011.1

!!Summary of Changes

  - This is the first release of the DNS-SD library.
  
!!Known Issues

  - None at this time.

!!Incompatible Changes and Possible Transition Issues

  - The DNS-SD library replaces the previously available Zeroconf library.
    Note that the DNS-SD library provides programming interfaces that are
    different from those provided by the old Zeroconf library. Those parts
    of an application interfacing with the Zeroconf library must be rewritten
    to use the new DNS-SD library. However, this usually affects only a
    very small part of an application and should not be much of an effort.
